    <h1>How to play snake?</h1>
    <p>The user controls a snake which continuously moves in the direction its’ head is facing.
        If the snake runs into one of the outer boundary walls or its’ own body, it will result in fatal injury to
        the snake and the player will lose the game as a result. An apple will always be spawned on the map, at a
        randomly generated location. The snake can eat apples by running over them. When the snake eats the apple
        that is on the map, the snake will grow 1 unit longer and another apple will appear in another randomly
        generated location. The goal of the game is to control the snake in such a way that it eats as many apples
        as possible (the snake grows as long as possible) without dying. This gets harder the larger the snake
        gets, because there will be less available space for the snake to move in its’ environment, so the game
        gets very strategic as the snake approaches longer lengths. <br>
